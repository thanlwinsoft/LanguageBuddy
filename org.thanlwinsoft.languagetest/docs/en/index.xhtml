<h1>Language Buddy</h1>
<p>Language Buddy is a self-study tool for learning words and phrases in a foreign language.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
Language Buddy stores test items according to language and script. As a minimum you need to define:</p>
<ol>
<li>your own language (or a language that you already know, that you will use to learn the new language)</li>
<li>the language that you want to learn</li>
</ol>
<p>The software asks you which script is used because some Asian languages are written in more than one script. e.g. an Asian script and a Romanized Latin script.</p>
<p>You can store more than one script for the same test item, so you can choose to have both an Asian script and a Romanisation. 
Test items can only have one foreign language. 
However, you may specify more than one language that you already know. 
Only One pair of native language/script, foreign language/script is used in a test. 
This may seem complicated, but it allows the same language modules to be used by learners whose mother tongue is different.
