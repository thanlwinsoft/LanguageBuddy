This utility tidies up the audio files that are used in your loaded modules. It will move all the audio files into a sub-folder with the same name as the module. If a test item only uses part of an audio file, then a new sound file will be created containing just the section of interest. If several items use the same audio file, then a new file will be created for each item using the appropriate time section.
</p>
<p>If several modules share the same audio file, then you should make sure that all these modules are loaded and run clean up from the Tools Menu.
</p>
<p style="color:red">It is advisable to backup your files before running this utility.</p>
<p>Do you want to start the clean up now?</p>
