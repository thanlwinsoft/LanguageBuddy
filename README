Language Buddy is a software self-test tool to help you learn words and phrases in a foreign language. You can group vocabulary into modules and then test yourself by:

    Listening to the word in the foreign language (if you have a recording)
    Reading the word in the foreign language and trying to remember the meaning
    Prompting in your own language so you have to translate it into the foreign language

You mark your self right or wrong when the answer is displayed. Wrong answers will be displayed repeatedly until you get it right. You then have the option to retest all your mistakes.
